This guide is intended to *supplement* the official F5 Application Connector `AskF5 Guide <https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/app-connector/manuals/product/f5-application-connector-setup-config-1-1-0.html>`_ 
with screenshots for quick deployment. Refer to the official guide for details.

.. NOTE::
The steps in this guide deploys both the Service Center and Proxy component in **Microsoft Azure**.
While this does not follow the typical hybrid cloud design, it does allow quick deployment of a 
test environment for Application Connector.
